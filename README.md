#### **Description**
This repository contains an implementation of a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) and a Classical Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the MNIST dataset. It explores the integration of quantum-inspired techniques, such as Quantum Stochastic Gradient Descent (QSGD), with classical optimization methods. The project aims to evaluate the performance of QCNNs against classical CNNs under various hyperparameter configurations.
